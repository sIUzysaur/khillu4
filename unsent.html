                <h1>THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SAY BUT NEVER DID</h1>
                <p>Khillu4, khillu4, khillu4, khillu4 I didn't want to talk to you at first because I wondered why I would talk to her if I wasn't a committed person. Because you know me well, I'm a man of my word. You know, principle over love, always. However, you're super kulit, aren't you? 
                    You always have chika na baon hahaha, and day by day I forget the things that I said to myself, because maybe, just maybe, this time things will work. And I invited you to my server to watch the Jeff documentary because we are both interested in that series. However, I didn't know you had a complicated relationship with your ex. I felt empty after reading those messages that you sent. It hurts to feel nothing.
                     I realized that I had already developed my feelings towards you. You made me vulnerable, and I know love makes us feel vulnerable.
                      My body couldn't function properly that day. I'm waiting for you to come home that day so that we can talk properly.
                       I'm glad that we talked about us. We're being honest with each other, and I'm glad that we fixed it.
                        And now we're okay, we're happy, but sometimes it's hard for me to think that you see your ex every single day.
                         I know my boundaries well. That's why I don't want to interfere with your relationship with him. You deserve better, Yana. And I want to be better for you, especially when it comes to physical, mental, and financial well-being. For now, the only thing that I can offer you is my presence, siuzy broke era huhuhu.</p>
           
                         <p>I realized that I didn't enjoy watching movies alone; I didn't enjoy playing valorant alone. All the things that I had done before, I want to do with you now: watch movies together, play games together, and many more. I realized that before I slept early, but now I want to spend my night with you, even though I'm a sleepy person. Like I said, we can't foresee our future, and if somehow things don't work out for us, always remember that I'm always proud of you bebe. Don't let other people abuse you, okay? Don't forget to drink water every hour. Also, eat food at the correct time. Don't sleep late at night, okay? I hope you can decide on what program you really want. You can come back here on the website if you want to. Always protect your peace, bebe. Always choose yourself, okay? If things get tough, remember to rest and cry. It will help you a lot. Love is not a weakness anymore. I love you. I mean it.</p>
