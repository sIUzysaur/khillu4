                <h1>THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT HER</h1>
                <p>Other than her personality and her physical appearance, the things that I like about her are: 
                    I like the way she makes me laugh and smile. Also, with her, I can be myself. She won't judge me. 
                    I can always talk to her since she has a lot of time. Also, she's super clingy, and I love that thing. She's also made me calm down. On top of that, she's also competitive as fuck. Every time we played gartic, I always lost the game. She's always cheered me up whenever I died on valorant, and I like how honest she is.
                     I love that thing, super. There are many reasons why I like this girl. I'll let you know soon, guys.</p>
