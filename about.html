                <h1>About her</h1>
                <p>She is indeed a bright woman I’ve ever met. She's good at academics. Unfortunately, she needed to stop for 1 year because she’s still undecided about what program she should take. She's good at doing house chores. She's good at taking care of Jade, her cousin. She's good at playing games, but she feels pressured all the time. She's good at singing. She said na her voice was nerfed huhu. What else? She's also pretty, 
                    but too humble to admit it. Her eyes and her smile were indeed beautiful. She also love mango graham and cheesecakes!! I like everything about this girl—I hope she finds the love that she deserves.</p>
