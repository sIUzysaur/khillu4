                <p> > What if you only love the idea of me loving you, but you don't love me as a whole?</p>
                <p> > What if you are distracted? </p>
                <p> > What if my presence is not enough? </p>
                <p> > What if one day you leave without saying good bye? </p>
                <p> > What if one day I leave because of our situation? </p>
                <p> > What if they get back together? </p>
                <p>All of those what if's, one thing I'm sure, I am sure that you have always belonged with me, and the memories that we create together.
                    You don't need to ask for assurance, time, and compliments; you deserve it all bebe. Whatever happens, you know that I'll always love you.
